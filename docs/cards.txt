Build a reusable `content-card.html` component for CineBrain. It should fetch 100% real-time data from the backend at https://backend-app-970m.onrender.com/api.

Requirements:

1. Poster image block at top (fixed aspect ratio 2:3), lazy-loaded.
2. Below image → title (line clamp to 2 lines) and release year.
3. Rating badge displayed top-right on poster.
4. Genre chips below title for context.
5. Bookmark icon (top-left on poster) for authenticated users (toggles watchlist).
6. Favorites icon (heart) next to bookmark for authenticated users (toggles favorites).
7. Hover/tap interaction: 
   - Desktop: subtle scale-up + shadow
   - Mobile: tap ripple or highlight
8. Fully responsive grid usage: 
   - Mobile: 2 cards per row
   - Tablet: 3–4 cards
   - Desktop: 5–6 cards
9. Self-contained CSS + JS inside the file (no external dependency other than Tailwind).
10. Click anywhere on the card (except bookmark/favorites icons) → navigates to `content/details.html?id={contentId}`.
11. Dark/light theme support (use Tailwind dark: utilities).
12. Real-time toggle updates: watchlist/favorites changes must immediately reflect in the backend via API calls.

Content Rows (scrollable carousels):

- Trending Now (movies, tv shows, anime) → pulls data from backend/app.py and https://backend-app-970m.onrender.com/api
- New Releases (movies, tv shows, anime) → pulls data from backend/app.py and https://backend-app-970m.onrender.com/api
- Critics Choice (movies, tv shows, anime) → pulls data from backend/app.py and https://backend-app-970m.onrender.com/api
- Popular Movies → pulls data from backend/app.py and https://backend-app-970m.onrender.com/api 
- Top Rated TV Shows → pulls data from backend/app.py and https://backend-app-970m.onrender.com/api
- Anime Picks → pulls data from backend/app.py and https://backend-app-970m.onrender.com/api 

Each row should be horizontal scrollable (with arrows on desktop, swipe on mobile).
