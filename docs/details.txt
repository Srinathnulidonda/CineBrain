Update my details pages with production-ready frontend details page (details.html, details.css, details.js) that consumes real-time data from a Flask backend. The implementation must follow best practices (clean code, responsive design, modular components) from the app.py, details.py, and content.js files and include:
The index page has the content.js which uses:
// Use slug-based URL (no parameter, just the slug after ?)
window.location.href = `/content/details.html?${encodeURIComponent(slug)}`;
Updates:
