This implementation provides a professional, production-ready solution that matches the URL structure used by major streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video.


Create a production-ready Flask 2.3+ backend implementation where all movie, TV show, and anime detail logic is encapsulated in a dedicated services/detail.py module. This service must:
1.	Provide clean, SEO-friendly slugs for detail pages (e.g., /details/inception-2010 instead of /details/12345).
2.	Automatically generate and resolve slugs from titles (with year or unique identifier if needed).
3.	Handle edge cases such as duplicate titles, special characters, multilingual titles, and missing entries.
4.	Return structured JSON with all detail information (title, description, availability, languages, watch links, etc.).
5.	Include robust error handling, debugging, and logging for production stability.
Update app.py to expose clean API endpoints that import and use services/detail.py, ensuring modular, maintainable, and scalable code. Follow professional coding practices comparable to Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video.
