You are a Principal Frontend Architect at a Fortune 100+ streaming company tasked with building CineBrain — a premium movie, TV series, and anime recommendation platform that must outperform Netflix, Disney+, and HBO Max in user experience, design, and performance.
The frontend must integrate seamlessly with backend/app.py and strictly follow the rules below.

🚨 CRITICAL RULES

Only 4 JS Files (Global):
o config.js, api.js, auth.js, app.js
o Page-specific logic/scripts → inline inside .html.
Only 6 CSS Files (Global):
o main.css, components.css, layouts.css, animations.css, responsive.css, theme.css
o Page-specific styles → inline inside .html.
Zero Placeholder Policy:
o No mocks, no dummies, no static placeholder content.
o Every component must fetch real data from https://backend-app-970m.onrender.com/api.
Ultra-Fast API Response (<100ms):
o Service Worker caching, retries, and prefetching required.
o Preload critical API endpoints during app boot.
Design Excellence:
o Use Bootstrap 5 + Tailwind CSS together.
o Must be world-class, cinematic, premium, and mobile-first.
o Outperform Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max in UX, design, and speed.
Vercel Config:
o A simple vercel.json file without version must be provided.

Before generating full pages, always provide the reusable component HTML files first with real-time integration and inline JavaScript inside them.

Component Requirements
Each .html must:
Contain fully functional UI + inline <script> (for page-specific logic if needed).
Fetch real backend data from:
https://backend-app-970m.onrender.com/api

Never use placeholders or mock content.
Be fully self-contained (can be dropped directly into a page and work).
Example Components
components/layout/topbar.html
Shows logo + tagline (CineBrain – The Mind Behind Your Next Favorite).
Search input with real-time autocomplete (/search).
User avatar with real username (via backend JWT + ui-avatars).

components/layout/mobile-nav.html
Fixed 5-tab mobile nav: Home, Search, Watchlist, Favorites, Profile.
Uses real-time user state (if logged in → show profile pic).
components/cards/content-card.html
Standard movie/show card.
Real poster, title, rating fetched from backend (/recommendations/trending, etc).
components/ui/rating-badge.html
Pulls actual rating (IMDb/Rotten) from /content/:id.
components/modals/trailer-modal.html
Autoplays real trailer from backend-provided YouTube/URL.
